# Key-Concepts in Medical Diagnosis 

1) Data pre-processing: checking for data leakage.

2) Preprocess images properly for the train, validation and test sets.

3) Implement a weighted loss function to address class imbalance.

4) Set up a pre-trained neural network to make disease predictions on chest x-rays.
